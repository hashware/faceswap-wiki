# Workflow
So, you want to swap faces in pictures and videos? Well hold up, because first you gotta understand what this collection of scripts will do, how it does it and what it can't currently do.

The basic operation of this script is simple. It trains a machine learning model to recognize and transform two faces based on pictures. The machine learning model is our little "bot" that we're teaching to do the actual swapping and the pictures are the "training data" that we use to train it. Note that the bot is primarily processing faces. Other objects might not work.

So here's our plan. We want to create a reality where Donald Trump lost the presidency to Nic Cage; we have his inauguration video; let's replace Trump with Cage.

## Gathering raw data
In order to accomplish this, the bot needs to learn to recognize both face A (Trump) and face B (Nic Cage). By default, the bot doesn't know what a Trump or a Nic Cage looks like. So we need to show it some pictures and let it guess which is which. So we need pictures of both of these faces first.

A possible source is Google, DuckDuckGo or Bing image search. There are scripts to download large amounts of images. Alternatively, if you have a video of the person you're looking for (from interviews, public speeches, or movies), you can convert this video to still images and use those. see [Extracting video frames](#Extracting_video_frames) for more information.

Feel free to list your image sets in the [faceswap-playground](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap-playground), or add more methods to this file.

So now we have a folder full of pictures of Trump and a separate folder of Nic Cage. Let's save them in our directory where we put the faceswap project. Example: `~/faceswap/photo/trump` and `~/faceswap/photo/cage`
