Training Guide

## TRAIN
The training process will take the longest, especially on CPU. We specify the folders where the two faces are, and where we will save our training model. It will start hammering the training data once you run the command. I personally really like to go by the preview and quit the processing once I'm happy with the results.

```bash
python faceswap.py train -A ~/faceswap/data/trump -B ~/faceswap/data/cage -m ~/faceswap/models/
# or -p to show a preview
python faceswap.py train -A ~/faceswap/data/trump -B ~/faceswap/data/cage -m ~/faceswap/models/ -p 
```

If you use the preview feature, select the preview window and press ENTER to save your processed data and quit gracefully. Without the preview enabled, you might have to forcefully quit by hitting Ctrl+C to cancel the command. Note that it will save the model once it's gone through about 100 iterations, which can take quite a while. So make sure you save before stopping the process.

You can see the full list of arguments for training via help flag. i.e.

```bash
python faceswap.py train -h
```
