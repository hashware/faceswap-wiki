## CONVERT
Now that we're happy with our trained model, we can convert our video. How does it work? Similarly to the extraction script, actually! The conversion script basically detects a face in a picture using the same algorithm, quickly crops the image to the right size, runs our bot on this cropped image of the face it has found, and then (crudely) pastes the processed face back into the picture.

Remember those initial pictures we had of Trump? Let's try swapping a face there. We will use that directory as our input directory, create a new folder where the output will be saved, and tell them which model to use.

```bash
python faceswap.py convert -i ~/faceswap/photo/trump/ -o ~/faceswap/output/ -m ~/faceswap/models/
```

It should now start swapping faces of all these pictures.

You can see the full list of arguments available for converting via help flag. i.e.

```bash
python faceswap.py convert -h
```

## GUI
All of the above commands and options can be run from the GUI. This is launched with:
```bash
python faceswap.py gui
```
