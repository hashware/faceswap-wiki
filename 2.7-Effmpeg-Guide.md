## Video's
A video is just a series of pictures in the form of frames. Therefore you can gather the raw images from them for your dataset or combine your results into a video.

## EFFMPEG
You can perform various video processes with the built in effmpeg tool. You can see the full list of arguments available by running:
```bash
python tools.py effmpeg -h
```

## Extracting video frames with FFMPEG
Alternatively you can split a video into seperate frames using [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) for instance. Below is an example command to process a video to seperate frames.

```bash
ffmpeg -i /path/to/my/video.mp4 /path/to/output/video-frame-%d.png
```

## Generating a video
If you split a video, using [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) for example, and used them as a target for swapping faces onto you can combine these frames again. The command below stitches the png frames back into a single video again.

```bash
ffmpeg -i video-frame-%0d.png -c:v libx264 -vf "fps=25,format=yuv420p" out.mp4
```
